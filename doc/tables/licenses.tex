    derivative work;

  \item you agree that you will not assert any moral rights in your

    project to which your contribution was submitted, and

  \item at our option, to sublicense these same rights to third parties
    through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.
  \end{itemize}

\item Except as set out above, you keep all right, title, and interest in
  your contribution. The rights that you grant to us under these terms are

  your submission took place before the date you sign these terms.

\item With respect to your contribution, you represent that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item it is an original work and that you can legally grant the rights set
    out in these terms;

  \item it does not to the best of your knowledge violate any third party's
    copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights;
    and

  \item you are authorized to sign this contract on behalf of your company
    (if identified below).
