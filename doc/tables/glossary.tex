\item[Bioloid] The Robotis Bioloid is a hobbyist and educational robot kit
  produced by the Korean robot manufacturer Robotis. The Bioloid platform
  consists of components and small, modular servomechanisms called
  Dynamixels, which can be used in a daisy-chained fashion to construct
  robots of various configurations, such as wheeled, legged, or humanoid
  robots. The Bioloid system is thus comparable to the LEGO Mindstorms and
  VEXplorer kits.

\item[Gostai Console] This tool provides a graphical user interface to a
  remote \urbi server (see \autoref{fig:gostai-console}).  Unix users
  (GNU/Linux or Mac OS X) can use the traditional \command{telnet} tool.
  Windows users are invited to use Gostai Console instead.  See
  \autoref{sec:tut:started}.

\item[Gostai Lab] This tool (see \autoref{fig:gostai-lab}), which
  includes the features of Gostai Console, allows to build easily

\item[Gostai Studio] This tool (see \autoref{fig:gostai-studio}),
  includes all the features of Gostai Console and Gostai Lab.  It is a
  high-level Integrated Development Environment for \urbi.  Its
  formalism is based on \dfn{Hierarchical Finite State Machines}.

\item[RMP] The Segway Robotic Mobility Platform is a robotic platform based
  on the Segway Personal Transporter.  See \url{http://rmp.segway.com}.

\item[RTP] Real-time Transport Protocol (RFC 3550).  A protocol designed for
  streaming (for instance audio/video).

\item[ROS] Robot Operating System, \url{http://www.ros.org/}, developed by
  Willow Garage, \url{http://www.willowgarage.com/}.  It is an abstraction
  layer on top of the genuine operating system (such as GNU/Linux) that
  provides hardware abstraction, device control, common algorithms,
  message-passing between processes, and package management.

\item[Spykee] The Spykee is a WiFi-enabled robot built by Meccano (known as
  Erector in the United States). It is equipped with a camera, speaker,
  microphone, and moves using two tracks. See
  \url{http://www.spykeeworld.com}.
