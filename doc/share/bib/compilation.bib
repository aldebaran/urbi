                  instruction selection for expression trees. More
                  importantly, the algorithm allows concise and
                  elegant specification of code generators. Aho,
                  Ganapathi, and Tjiang have built the Twig
                  code-generator-generator, which produces
                  dynamic-programming code-generators from
                  grammar-like specifications.  Encoding a complex
                  architecture as a grammar for a dynamic-programming
                  codegenerator -generator shows the expressive power
                  of the technique. Each instruction, addressing mode,
                  register and class can be expressed individually in
                  the grammar. The grammar can be factored much more
                  readily than with the Graham-Glanville LR(1)
                  algorithm, so it can be much more concise. Twig
                  specifications for the VAX and MC68020 are
                  described, and the corresponding code generators
                  select very good (and under the right assumptions,
                  optimal) instruction sequences.  Limitations and
                  possible improvements to the specification language
                  are discussed.},

                  are common in compiler design courses, but even a
                  small compiler can be daunting to students with no
                  prior compiler-writing experience. When I recently
                  taught compiler design, I developed a very small
                  language with a highly modular compiler, focusing
                  the project on implementing the core parts of a
                  compiler without requiring students to build all the
                  infrastructure from scratch. This paper describes
                  the language and its compiler, and their successes
                  (and occasional limitations) for teaching compiler
                  design.},
