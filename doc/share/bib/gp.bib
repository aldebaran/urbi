                  for decoupling subtyping and inheritance in
                  C++. This extension gives the user more of the
                  flexibility of dynamic typing while retaining the
                  efficiency and security of static typing. After a
                  brief discussion of syntax and semantics of this
                  language extension and examples of its use, we
                  present and analyze three different implementation
                  techniques: a preprocessor to a C++ compiler, an
                  implementation in the front end of a C++ compiler,
                  and a low-level implementation with back-end
                  support. We follow with an analysis of the
                  performance of the three implementation techniques
                  and show that our extension actually allows subtype
                  polymorphism to be implemented more efficiently than
                  with virtual functions. We conclude with a
                  discussion of the lessons we learned for future
                  programming language design.}

                  insecure type-systems or to restrictions on
                  inheritance that make it less flexible than untyped
                  Smalltalk inheritance. We present a new typed model
                  of inheritance that allows more of the flexibility
                  of Smalltalk inheritance within a statically-typed
                  system. Significant features of our analysis are the
                  introduction of polymorphism into the typing of
                  inheritance and the uniform application of
                  inheritance to objects, classes and types. The
                  resulting notion of type inheritance allows us to
                  show that the type of an inherited object is an
                  inherited type but not always a subtype.}

                  executable inspection and processor simulation. Our
                  results show that the C++ programs measured spend a
                  median of 5.2\% of their time and 3.7\% of their
                  instructions in dispatch code. For "all virtuals"
                  versions of the programs, the median overhead rises
                  to 13.7\% (13\% of the instructions). The "thunk"
                  variant of the virtual function table implementation
                  reduces the overhead by a median of 21\% relative to
                  the standard implementation. On future processors,
                  these overheads are likely to increase moderately.}

  year =	 {2000},
  abstract =	 {We present an extensible framework for defining and
                  using ``static interfaces'' in C++. Static
                  interfaces are especially useful as constraints on
                  template parameters. That is, in addition to the
                  usual template $class T$, template definitions can
                  specify that T ``isa'' Foo, for some static
                  interface named Foo. These ``isa-constraints'' can
                  be based on either inheritance (named conformance: T
                  publicly inherits Foo), members (structural
                  conformance: T has these member functions with these
                  signatures), or both. The constraint mechanism
                  imposes no space or time overheads at runtime;
                  virtual functions are conspicuously absent from our
                  framework. We demonstrate two key utilities of
                  static interfaces. First, constraints enable better
                  error messages with template code. By applying
                  static interfaces as constraints, instantiating a
                  template with the wrong type is an error that can be
                  caught at the instantiation point, rather than later
                  (typically in the bowels of the
                  implementation). Authors of template classes and
                  template functions can also dispatch ``custom error
                  messages'' to report named constraint violations by
                  clients, making debugging easier. We show examples
                  of the improvement of error messages when
                  constraints are applied to STL code. Second,
                  constraints enable automatic compile-time dispatch
                  of different implementations of class or function
                  templates based on the named conformance properties
                  of the template types. For example, $Set<T>$ can be
                  written to automatically choose the most efficient
                  implementation: use a hashtable implementation if
                  ``T isa Hashable'', or else a binary search tree if
                  ``T isa LessThanComparable'' , or else a linked-list
                  if merely ``T isa EqualityComparable''. This
                  dispatch can be completely hidden from clients of
                  Set, who just use $Set<T>$ as usual.},

                  possible to simulate genericity using inheritance,
                  but not vice-versa. This is because genericity is a
                  parameterization mechanism with no way to deal with
                  the polymorphic typing introduced using
                  inheritance. Nevertheless, if we focus on the use of
                  inheritance as an implementation technique, its key
                  feature is the dynamic binding of self-referential
                  operation calls. This turns out to be basically a
                  parameterization mechanism that can in fact be
                  simulated using generics and static binding. And for
                  some applications this approach may actually be of
                  more than academic interest. --------------------
                  This paper discusses how the use of generics for the
                  static-binding of self-referential calls is
                  important in the comparison of inheritance and
                  genericity. It discusses how the generic approach
                  gives the programmer much more precise control about
                  when and where self-referential bindings are made
                  and thus makes the use and intent of self-reference
                  more apparent to the software maintainer. The paper
                  notes that the generic approach provides
                  self-reference and deferred operation implementation
                  with fully static binding, thus avoiding the
                  suspicion with which many dynamic constructs are
                  regarded. The paper shows how inheritance can be
                  simulated by type plus polymorphic typing plus
                  genericity, and that the generic approach has some
                  potential advantages. }

                  use of template parameters to represent abstract
                  data types (or ``concepts''). However, the C++
                  language itself does not provide a mechanism for
                  explicitly handling concepts. As a result, it can be
                  difficult to insure that a concrete type meets the
                  requirements of the concept it is supposed to
                  represent. Error messages resulting from incorrect
                  use of a concrete type can be particularly difficult
                  to decipher. In this paper we present techniques to
                  check parameters in generic C++ libraries. Our

                  C++ and Haskell in light of the past decade of
                  generic library research and development. Based on
                  this analysis we propose and evaluate relevant
                  language design decisions for G. Generic programming
                  is concerned with the construction of libraries of
                  reusable software components and is inherently about
                  programming ``in the large.'' Thus, the design of G
                  places its greatest emphasis on modularity and
                  safety, while also providing run-time efficiency and
                  programmer convenience. This paper focuses on name
                  scoping and type checking for generic functions,
                  support for dispatching to algorithm
                  specializations, support for type associations among
                  abstractions, and separate compilation. The
                  resulting design for G includes three novel aspects:
                  scoped models declarations, nested types in
                  concepts, and optional type constraints on generic
                  functions.}

                  compilers. Type analysis is removed from the
                  compiler and replaced with a `type system library'
                  which is treated as source code by the
                  compiler. Type computations are embedded in the
                  intermediate language of the compiler, and partial
                  evaluation is used to drive type analysis and
                  template instantiation. By making simple changes to
                  the behavior of the partial evaluator, a wide range
                  of compilation models is achieved, each with a
                  distinct tradeoff of compile time, code size, and
                  code speed. These models range from pure dynamic
                  typing -- ideal for scripting C++ -- to
                  profile-directed template instantiation. This
                  approach may solve several serious problems in
                  compiling C++: it achieves separate compilation of
                  templates, allows template code to be distributed in
                  binary form by deferring template instantiation
                  until run time, and reduces the code bloat
                  associated with templates.}

                  frustrating be-cause optimizing compilers for
                  imperative languages tend to be unpre-dictable. For
                  a subset of optimizations those that simplify rather
                  than reorder code it would be useful to prove that a
                  compiler reliably per-forms optimizations. We show
                  that adopting a superanalysis approach to
                  optimization enables such a proof. By analogy with
                  linear algebra, we define the nullspace of an
                  optimizer as those programs it reduces to the empty
                  program. To span the nullspace, we define rewrite
                  rules that de-optimize programs by introducing
                  abstraction. For a model compiler we prove that any
                  sequence of de-optimizing rewrite rule applications
                  is undone by the optimizer. Thus, we are able to
                  give programmers a clear mental model of what
                  simplifications the compiler is guaranteed to
                  perform, and make progress on the problem of
                  abstraction penalty in imperative languages.}

                  uses a fast simple inference mechanism to remove
                  most last binding calls, replacing them by static
                  bindings. Starting from the system's entry point, it
                  compiles only statically living code, which saves
                  compiling and then removing dead code. As the whole
                  system is analyzed at compile time, multiple
                  inheritance and genericity do not cause any
                  overhead. SmallEiffel features a coding scheme which
                  eliminates the need for virtual function
                  tables. Dynamic dispatch is implemented without any
                  array access but uses a simple static binary branch
                  code. We show that this implementation makes it
                  possible to use modern hardware very efficiently. It
                  also allows to inline more calls even when dynamic
                  dispatch is required. Some more dispatch sites are
                  removed after the type inference algorithm has been
                  performed, if the different branches of a dispatch
                  site lead to the same code. The advantage of this
                  approach is that it greatly speeds up execution time
                  and considerably decreases the amount of generated
                  code.}
