		  the first of the two viewing stage operations: required

		  We propose a classification, extending the existing

		  only required elements (culling), and keeping only required
		  details (which includes traditional LODs). The mechanisms
		  needed for display scalability are presented.}

  abstract	= {This paper presents Olena, a toolkit for programming and
		  designing image processing chains in which each processing
		  is a component. But since there exist many image types
		  (different structures such as 2D images, 3D images or
		  graphs, as well as different value types) the platform has
		  been designed with genericity and reusability in mind: each
		  component is written as a generic C++ procedure, la STL.
		  Other libraries, such as Khoros [Kon94] have a different
		  approach where a processing component contains an
		  implementation for each type supported by the library. This
		  makes code maintenance hard and prevents easy addition of
		  new image types. Still, Olena is not only a generic
		  component library [Jaz95], it shall contain additional
		  tools such as a visual programming environment (VPE). Those
		  tools may be programmed in a classical object-oriented
		  fashion (using operation and inclusion polymorphism) which
		  may seems antagonist with the generic programming paradigm
		  used in the library. Section 2 outlines the architecture of
		  Olena and elaborates more on the design problems resulting
		  from the use of generic components. Section 3 presents the
		  solution chosen to address these problems.}

		  to the extraction of curvilinear ob jects. Many road
		  extractors can be found in the literature which are
		  composed of two stages. The first one acts like a filter
		  that can decide from a local analysis, at every image
		  point, if there is a road or not. The second stage aims at
		  obtaining the road network structure. In the method we
		  propose, we rely on a "potential" image, that is,
		  unstructured image data that can be derived from any road
		  extractor filter. In such a potential image, the value
		  assigned to a point is a measure of its likelihood to be
		  located in the middle of a road. A filtering step applied
		  on the potential image relies on the area closing operator
		  followed by the watershed transform to obtain a connected
		  line which encloses the road network. Then a graph
		  describing adjacency relationships between watershed lines
		  is built. Defining Markov random fields upon this graph,
		  associated with an energetic model of road networks, leads
		  to the expression of road network extraction as a global
		  energy minimization problem. This method can easily be
		  adapted to other image processing fields where the
		  recognition of curvilinear structures is involved.}

		  to verify whether some fixed property holds on individual

		  join the strengths of both approaches by introducing a new
		  notion of probabilistic abstraction, and by extending the
		  framework of model checking to include the use of these
		  abstractions. Our abstractions map transition systems
		  associated with large graphs to small transition systems
		  associated with small random subgraphs. This reduces the
		  original transition system to a family of small, even
		  constant-size, transition systems. We prove that with high
		  probability, ``sufficiently'' incorrect programs will be
		  rejected ($\eps$-robustness). We also prove that under a
		  certain condition (exactness), correct programs will never
		  be rejected (soundness). Our work applies to programs for
		  graph properties such as bipartiteness, $k$-colorability,
		  or any $\exists\forall$ first order graph properties. Our
		  main contribution is to show how to apply the ideas of
		  property testing to syntactic programs for such properties.
		  We give a concrete example of an abstraction for a program
		  for bipartiteness. Finally, we show that the relaxation of
		  the test alone does not yield transition systems small
		  enough to use the standard model checking method. More

		  and caching strategies. For this, we introduce a new
		  algorithm -- running on GPU -- to solve the major
		  difficulty of detecting which parts of the texture are
		  required for rendering. Our system is based on three
		  components manipulating a tile pool which stores texture
		  data in GPU memory. First, the Texture Load Map determines
		  at every frame the appropriate list of texture tiles (i.e.
		  location and MIP-map level) to render from the current
		  viewpoint. Second, the Texture Cache manages the tile pool.
		  Finally, the Texture Producer loads and decodes required
		  texture tiles asynchronously in the tile pool. Decoding of
		  compressed texture data is implemented on GPU to minimize
		  texture transfer. The Texture Producer can also generate
		  procedural textures. Our system is transparent to the user,
		  and the only parameter that must be supplied at runtime is
		  the current viewpoint. No modifications of the mesh are
		  required. We demonstrate our system on large scenes
		  displayed in real time. We show that it achieves
