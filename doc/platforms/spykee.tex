\chapter{Spykee}
\label{sec:spykee}

The \dfn{Spykee} is a WiFi-enabled robot built by Meccano (known as
Erector in the United States). It is equipped with a camera, speaker,
microphone, and moves using two tracks.

\section{Installing Urbi on the Spykee}

To enable Urbi in the Spykee, you must update it with a new firmware. The Urbi
firmware can be downloaded from \url{http://www.gostai.com}.

  \label{fig:spykee:install}
\end{figure}

Once obtained, use the Spykee interface.  To install it (see
\autoref{fig:spykee:install}): Download it from
\url{http://spykeeworld.com}, start the interface, connect to your robot,
click on the ``settings'' button, then on the Spykee image on the left.
Then go to the ``Firmware'' tab, and click the ``Load'' button. Select the
firmware file you downloaded earlier, and press OK. Leave the Spykee on its
base until it reboots, the update process will take a few minutes. Do not
reboot the Spykee yourself while update is in progress or you might render
it useless.

With the \urbi firmware, the Spykee should continue to work as usual: you
can still control it using the Spykee interface. But you can now also
control it with \urbi.


\section{Device list}

The following standard devices are available on the Spykee:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|trackL, trackR (Motor)| \\
    The two tracks. The \lstinline|val| slot can be read or set to change each
    track speed, from -100 to 100.
\item \lstinline|ledL, ledR, headLed (Led)| \\
    left and right led pairs, and camera light. On if the \lstinline|val| slot
    is set to 1.
\item \lstinline|camera (VideoIn)| \\
    Spykee camera. The \lstinline|val| slot contains the last received image
    in jpeg format.
\item \lstinline|speaker (AudioOut)| \\
    Sound speaker.
\item \lstinline|micro (AudioIn)| \\
    Microphone.
\item \lstinline|robot (Mobile)| \\
    Provides the standard functions go() and turn().
\end{itemize}

The following non-standard functions are also present:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|speaker.playSound(\var{id})| \\
  Play Spykee sound sample \var{id}, from 0 to 15.
\item \lstinline|mp3.play(stream)| \\
  Play mp3 file or http stream \var{stream}.
\item \lstinline|mp3.stop()| \\
  Stop playing current stream or file.
\item \lstinline|Spykee.setConfigValue(\var{key}, \var{value})| \\
  Set persistent configuration entry \var{key} to \var{value}. Beware
  that the configuration sector only have a few kilobytes of space, do
  not put too many or to big values here.
\item \lstinline|Spykee.getConfigValue(\var{key})| \\
  Retrieve persistent value associated with \var{key}. Do not call
  this function two often as it is very costly.
\item \lstinline|Spykee.findBase()| \\
  Ask the Spykee to look for its base and station on it.
\item \lstinline|Spykee.cancelFindBase()| \\
  Abort the previous order.
\item \lstinline|Spykee.chargeStop()| \\
  Ask the Spykee to stop charging and exit its charging station.
\item \lstinline|Spykee.power| \\
  Remaining energy in the battery, from 0 to 100. The value may be
  inaccurate or outside the range while the Spykee is charging.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dynamically loaded modules}
At start-up, the Spykee tries to connect to the spykee.gostai.com website to
fetch a list of additional features available for download.
It sets up the system in a way that the first attempt to use one of those
additional features will download and load the required objects.

The location where the modules are fetched can be changed by setting the
\lstinline|loader_host| and \lstinline|loader_dir| configuration values (using
\lstinline|Spykee.setConfigValue()|).
Default values are \em{spykee.gostai.com} and \em{/modules/}.

The following modules are currently available:

\subsection{Clapper}

The Clapper module detects and counts short and loud sounds, such as the one
made by clapping  hands. It can be instantiate by typing:

\begin{urbiunchecked}
var Global.clap = Clapper.new("micro.val", 0.2, 200, 800, 4000);
\end{urbiunchecked}

The second parameter is the volume threshold above which a clap is detected.
The third and fourth parameters are the minimum and maximum delay between claps,
in milliseconds. The last argument is the maximum duration of a sound sequence.

Each time a clap sequence ends, the \lstinline|val| slot of the object is
set to the number of claps heard, then reset to 0.
Additionally, if \lstinline|emitEvent| is true, the event \lstinline|sequence|
is emitted with one argument: the number of claps heard.

\begin{urbiunchecked}
clap.emitEvent = 1;
// Play sound sample number 3 when two successive claps are heard.
tag:at(clap.sequence?(2)) speaker.playSound(3);
// Stop the previous behavior.
tag.stop;
\end{urbiunchecked}
