                  signals, or time-varying values. In this paper, we
                  present a new language called FrTime, which provides
                  FRP-style signals atop a dialect of Scheme. We
                  introduce the language with a few examples and
                  discuss its implementation. Unlike previous FRP
                  systems, FrTime uses impure features, such as state
                  and asynchronous communication, to model time and to
                  control evaluation. The use of such features yields
                  a scalable, event-driven implementation with several
                  important advantages. Specifically, it eases
                  integration with other systems, supports
                  distribution of signals across a network, and
                  permits various benign impurities. To illustrate the
                  language's expressive power, we present a concise
                  implementation of a networked paddle-ball game in

                  control and monitoring systems --- as well as for
                  describing hardware. The dataflow aspect of Lustre
                  makes it very close to usual description tools in
                  these domains (block-diagrams, networks of
                  operators, dynamical samples-systems, etc...),
                  and its synchronous interpretation makes it well
                  suited for handling time in programs. Moreover, this
                  synchronous interpretation allows it to be compiled
                  into an efficient sequential program. Finally, the
                  Lustre formalism is very similar to temporal
                  logics. This allows the language to be used for both
                  writing programs and expressing program properties,
                  which results in an original program verification

                  systems as found in graphical user interfaces, video
                  games or simulation problems. The language is based
                  on the reactive model introduced by Boussinot. This
                  model combines the so-called synchronous model found
                  in Esterel which provides instantaneous
                  communication and parallel composition with
                  classical features found in asynchronous models like
                  dynamic creation of processes.  The language comes
                  as a conservative extension of an existing
                  call-by-value ML language and it provides additional
                  constructs for describing the temporal part of a
                  system. The language receives a behavioral semantics
                  \`a la Esterel and a transition semantics describing
                  precisely the interaction between ML values and
                  reactive constructs. It is statically typed through
                  a Milner type inference system and programs are
                  compiled into regular ML programs. The language has
                  been used for programming several complex simulation
                  problems (e.g., routing protocols in mobile ad-hoc

                  operators that allow to combine Boolean Mealy

                  origin in Statecharts, but with the Argos operators,
                  one can build only a subset of Statecharts, roughly

                  explain the main motivations for the definition of
                  Argos, and the main differences with Statecharts and
                  their numerous semantics. We define the set of
                  operators, give them a perfectly synchronous
                  semantics in the sense of Esterel, and prove that it
                  is compositional, with respect to the trace
