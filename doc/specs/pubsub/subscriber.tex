\section{PubSub.Subscriber}

\lstinline|Subscriber| is created by \refSlot[PubSub]{subscribe}.  It
provides methods to access to the list of values published by
\lstinline|PubSub| instances.

\subsection{Prototypes}

\begin{refObjects}
\item[Object]
\end{refObjects}

\subsection{Construction}

A \lstinline|PubSub.Subscriber| can be created with a call to
\refSlot[PubSub]{subscribe}.  This way of creating a \lstinline|Subscriber|
adds the subscriber as a watcher of values published on the instance of
\refObject{PubSub}.

\begin{urbiscript}[firstnumber=1]
var ps = PubSub.new |;
var sub = ps.subscribe;
[00000000] Subscriber_0x28607c0
\end{urbiscript}

%% PubSub.Subscriber.new is not documented because there is no method to add
%% a subscriber into the list of subscribers of a PubSub instance except by
%% doing it in a dirty way.  This may allow to have a subscriber watching
%% multiple published values.
\subsection{Slots}

\begin{urbiscriptapi}

%% \lstinline|enqueue(\var{ev})| is not documented because I assume it is an
%% implementation detail of PubSub.
\item[getOne]
  Block until a value is accessible and return it.  If a value is already
  queued, then the method returns it without blocking.

\begin{urbiscript}
echo(sub.getOne) &
ps.publish(3);
[00000000] *** 3
\end{urbiscript}


\item[getAll] Block until a value is accessible.  Return the list of
  queued values.  If the values are already queued, then return them
  without blocking.

\begin{urbiscript}
ps.publish(4) |
ps.publish(5) |
echo(sub.getAll);
[00000000] *** [4, 5]
\end{urbiscript}

\end{urbiscriptapi}
