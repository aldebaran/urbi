\chapter*{About this part}

This part defines the specifications of the \us language version
2.0. It defines the expected behavior from the \us interpreter, the
standard library, and the \sdk. It can be used to check whether some
code is valid, or browse \us or \Cxx \api for a desired
feature. Random reading can also provide you with advanced knowledge
or subtleties about some \us aspects.

This part is not an \us tutorial; it is not structured in a
progressive manner and is too detailed.  Think of it as a dictionary:
one does not learn a foreign language by reading a dictionary. The \us
Tutorial (\autoref{part:tut}), or the live \us tutorial built in the
interpreter are good introductions to \us.

This part does not aim at giving advanced programming techniques. Its
only goal is to define the language and its libraries.
